## This is not a beginner's Python guide. 
It's more of an **intermediate guide** for the junior Python devs who have a grasp on the basics.
If you are comfortable to take on some more Python.... *dive in quickly*. 
This repository contains several code snippets which can be used to make your code more pythonic.

##### NOTE: This repo is still in WIP and I'll keep updating the repo as frequently as possible.

## How can you get most out of this repo?
You can access the list of topics that are already in here. There are links to code files for that topic. 
Every code file has well commented code as to why certain things are being done. 
In future these code comments can be compiled together to form blogs ðŸ˜…

## List of topics:
1. [Why and how to use `__str__` and `__repr__` methods?](https://github.com/ayushmahajan/my-python-learning/blob/master/OOP%20in%20Python/OOP_String_Conversion.py) 
2. [`super()` and why is it used?](https://github.com/ayushmahajan/my-python-learning/blob/master/OOP%20in%20Python/Super_in_Python.py)
